# Lab 1: Setting the Stage
The Goal To move from a blank slate to a fully functional Machine Learning powerhouse using Python, Anaconda, and VS Code.

### What’s Done
1- **Environment Hub:** Got Anaconda Navigator up and running to handle the heavy lifting of environment management.

2- **Connected the Dots:** Synced VS Code with the Python interpreter so the code actually knows where its brains are.

3- **Library Audit:** Ran a quick roll call for pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. They’re installed, imported, and ready for data.

4- **Git Ready:** Initialized the repo and sorted out the config. No "identity unknown" errors to see here.
