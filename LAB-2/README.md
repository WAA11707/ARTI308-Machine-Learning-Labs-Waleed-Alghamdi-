# Lab 2: Heart Failure Prediction - ML Problem Definition

**Student Name:** Waleed Adel Alghamdi
**Course:** ARTI 308 – Machine Learning (2025/2026)

## Problem Statement
* **Dataset Name:** Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset
* **Dataset Source:** Kaggle / UCI Machine Learning Repository
* [cite_start]**Problem Type:** Binary Classification [cite: 73, 95]
* **Description:** Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This project aims to use a clinical dataset containing 12 features (such as age, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction) to predict the survival of patients with heart failure. [cite_start]The model will learn patterns from clinical history to distinguish between patients who survived and those who did not during the follow-up period. [cite: 76, 98]
* [cite_start]**Target Variable:** `DEATH_EVENT` (Boolean: 0 = Survived, 1 = Deceased) [cite: 75, 96]
